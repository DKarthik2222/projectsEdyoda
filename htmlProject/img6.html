    <p class="text"><b>Niagara Falls</b></p>
    <p class="text">
        Niagara Falls /naɪˈæɡrə, naɪˈæɡərə/ is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between the province of Ontario in Canada and New York state in the United States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, also known as Canadian Falls, which straddles the international border of the two countries. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls are separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island, with both islands situated in New York.

    <p class="text">
        Located on the Niagara River, which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario, the combined falls have the highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than 50 metres (160 ft). During peak daytime tourist hours, more than 168,000 m3 (six million cubic feet) of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute.[2] Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful waterfall in North America, as measured by flow rate.[3]
